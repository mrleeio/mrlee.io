      Hello, my name is Michael. I hold multiple cybersecurity certifications and primarily write about the intersection of software engineering, security, and leadership. In my free time, I enjoy listening to [new retro music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URma_gu1aNE), walking my dog, and cycling.

      You can contact me at [michael@mrlee.io](mailto:michael@mrlee.io).
